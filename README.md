# klipsch-remote-control
IRPlus and lirc remote config files for Klipsch R-41PM (actually used codes from Klipsch R-15PM). Probably will work with other Reference series speakers with similar functionality.

Used file from http://www.hifi-remote.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=102479 which was then converted to `*.girr` file by [IrMaster](http://www.harctoolbox.org/IrMaster.html)
and then converted to both `irplus` and `lircd` config files by [IRScrutinizer](https://github.com/bengtmartensson/IrScrutinizer).

`lircd` config file is not tested yet.
